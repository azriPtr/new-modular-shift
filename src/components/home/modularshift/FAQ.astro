        <h3 class="mb-2 font-semibold">Will rebuilding our website hurt our SEO rankings?</h3>
        <p>
          No — the opposite. At ModularShift, we run parallel environments, preserve URL structures,
          and set up 301 redirects where needed. Combined with Core Web Vitals optimisation, schema
          markup, and AI-friendly content structures, most clients see a net increase in search
          visibility and organic traffic after launch.

          Can you integrate our website with our existing CRM and marketing tools?
        </h3>
        <p>
          Yes. We specialise in CRM and automation integrations — from HubSpot and Salesforce to
          Oomi and custom platforms. We connect your website forms, lead capture, and analytics
          directly to your CRM so your sales and marketing teams can track ROI in real time without
          manual data entry.

          How quickly can you launch a new high-performance website?
        </h3>
        <p>
          Most projects launch within 8–12 weeks, depending on scope. We take a phased approach:
          starting with a fast, SEO-strong foundation, then layering on advanced features like AI
          visibility, automation, and lead management systems. This way, you get measurable wins
          early without waiting months for results.

        <h3 class="mb-2 font-semibold">What ongoing support do you provide after launch?</h3>
        <p>
          We don’t just hand over a website and disappear. ModularShift offers continuous
          monitoring, security updates, analytics reporting, and performance optimisation. As your
          needs evolve, we can also add new modules — from AI-powered SEO enhancements to lead
          dashboards and chatbot integrations.
