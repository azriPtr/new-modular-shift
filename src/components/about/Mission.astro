              At ModularShift, our mission is to help ambitious brands grow faster with digital
              platforms that are built for performance, visibility, and scale. We believe websites
              should do more than sit online — they should be powerful engines that attract
              customers, generate leads, and prove ROI.
            </p>
            <p class="text-base text-primary-950/70 dark:text-primary-200/70 sm:text-lg">
              We know that for many organisations, websites become slow, outdated, and hard to
              manage. Content teams struggle to publish safely, sales teams can’t track leads, and
              marketing feels disconnected from real results. That’s why we exist: to take away the
              complexity and replace it with clarity.
            </p>
            <p class="text-base text-primary-950/70 dark:text-primary-200/70 sm:text-lg">
              By combining high-performance frameworks, modern CMS workflows, SEO and AI readiness,
              and integrated lead systems, we give businesses a digital foundation they can trust.
              Our mission is to make growth not just possible, but inevitable — with platforms that
              keep improving over time.
